In this repository, I have included all my code for parts 1, 2, & 3 of the software challenge alongside the processed results and a brief description for each part. In order to run my code, you
need to have the original, unprocessed videos/images already downloaded onto your computer. These are located in the repository. Also, make sure that the open cv2 is installed and that you have
changed the path in my code to the respective paths of each video and image on your computer.
