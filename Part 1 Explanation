To complete this part of the challenge, I started by researching how to apply contours to an image in Open CV and how the image needs to
be processed before contours are applied. I decided to begin by calculating the average color of all the pixels in the image and
subtracting that value from each pixel in the image. Adding a limit to make sure no negative RGB values existed made all the pixels in the
image that had similar values to the average value turn black. Additionally, I added a mask to change the value of all pixels that were
close enough in value to 0 to 0. This made the grass in the background entirely black. Every pixel that wasnâ€™t changed to the color black
was changed to the color white, allowing all the shapes to contrast well with the black background. Since the image was now entirely black
and white, I could process it to grayscale and detect the contours as well as draw points at the centroids of each shape. I also added a
condition to make sure that if the area of the contour drawn was below a limit value, the contour would not be drawn. This was done to
eliminate any white spots resulting from the processed image.
