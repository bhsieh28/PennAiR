Finally, for part 3, I tried applying the same algorithm that I used for part 2 and part 1 while also modifying my mask to accommodate
the different colors in the background. The major challenge that I faced during this part was being able to filter out the background
so I could trace the contours while also maintaining the ability to recognize the shape. My algorithm takes the average color of the
background and subtracts its value from each pixel. However, some of the pixel values from the shapes like the blue part of the hexagon
and the ends of the trapezoid were too close in value to the average color and were filtered out in the process. In order to fix this, I
changed the values of the average color and adjusted the upper and lower limits of the mask. This adjustment worked in helping me identify
the shapes better but it also resulted in the mask working less effectively at filtering out the background pixels. As a result, my final
video for this part of the challenge has some extra contours surrounding the shapes from the spots in the background that were not properly
filtered out.
